# Campaign Company Technical

This project was made using React for the creation of an election calculator for New Zealand politcal parties.

## Technologies

I have chosen React as I was originally intending to perform this in Javascript and HTML. As I had very recently begun to learn REACT, I decided to try out my current understanding to create this app. I will continue to be learning REACT following this technical test, but as it was one the job specification originally mentioned it seemed worth showing off my capability to learn quickly.

## requirements

To run this project you must:

- Clone this github repository.
- Type `npm install`
- Type `npm start`

### other

There are some known possible issues with this calculator compared to any others designed, mostly these arise through choices which I had to make.

- I decided to divide the 'wasted votes' from other parties between the eligible parties by percentage of their total won voting rather than evenly.
- I have decided to go with largest remainder for certain rounding elements.

Thank you
